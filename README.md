# Location Based Quiz - User Interface App

This repository contains the code used to create a phonegap app that is the user interface for a location based quiz. This app aims to:

* Download the questions that have been created by the administrator from a database and show them as markers on a Leaflet map.
* Show the user's current location.
* Colour the question markers according to their distance from the user's location.
* Present the question upon the user cliking any marker within 20m of their current location.
* Inform the user whether they got the question correct.
* Send the answers to a database.
